1) How does the find_by method work?

  find_by(params[:id])
  It takes an argument, which is the params (input of a user), which is a hash like so
  params = {product {id: 1, name: "shamwow", etc}
  so params[:id] (when called within a model controller) will return product[:id]

  (^there has to be an easier way to describe this)

2) What are flash notices and errors? What data type do they resemble?

  Flash notices and errors are message that signal to the user that they are not
  fulfilling certain input requirements. Data type?


3) How do we define a helper method?

  A helper method is created within the ApplicationController that allows this method
  to be called in the views.



4) In which file can we find <%= yield %>? What is it's purpose?

  It is found in the application view. The application view structures the overall
  layout of each view page. The yield section displays the individual contents of each
  view page. (is there a more eloquent way to put this??)



5) What are associations? What are the different types of associations?

  Associations allow to tables that are not directly linked to each other (they
  do not contain each other's foreign_ids) to be connected through a mutually associated
  table.

  Different types of associations:
  - has_one
  - has_one :through
  - has_many
  - has_many :through
  - belongs_to
  - has_and_belongs_to_many



6) Which Rails component is responsible for their implementation?

  Associations are implemented in models.



7) What is a before_filter and when does it run?

  A before_filter is a condition that is set in the controllers. It runs before
  or after or around
  whatever you set the condition to.



8) How do we create a nested form?

  A nested form is created in the routes.rb file by putting 'do' after the primary
  form and inserting the form to be nested after the line.

9) How have we implemented authorization in Rainforest?

  We used the bcrypt gem, which makes sure that a user's password is not stored
  as plaintext, using the password_digest input. By using this gem, we must also
  add a password_confirmation requirement in the new users form, unless it is set
  to nil, which means that the bcrypt gem wouldn't be activated.

10) How do we add a column to a database?

   rails g migration AddNameToUser name:string

   This creates a new migration that indicates that a "name" column has been
   adde to the user model, and indicates the properties of the name.
